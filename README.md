## What to Use Lodash For and When To Use It

LoDash is a hassle-free way of handling Javascripts datatypes, by using small packages of pre-written code called modules to achieve programming goals.

These modules are organized together into a powerful utility library that improves the performance of your code, and gives you a few bonuses.

One way you would use it is if you wanted to cycle or iterate through the information in an object or array (two common JavaScript datatype) in a special way. Another is to build functions (methods of handling tasks) that contain other functions.
